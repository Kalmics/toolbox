      <guid>/pages/digitization-and-editing/3.5_validating_with_josm/</guid>
      <description>Overview Validation is a process of checking the data quality (in this case, map data quality) for accuracy, consistency, completeness and anomaly. Validation is important to maintain the quality of OSM data. When checking for accuracy, you need to make sure that the map data is aligned with the imagery and is correct in terms of geometry. For consistency, make sure that all mapped objects are consistent in shape. For example, when you found a residential area, make sure all the buildings are consistently traced and orthogonalized.</description>

      <description>Overview When beginning a mapping project, many organizations ask if they need to have a server. After collecting data, you’ll need to get the data from the devices. Sometimes, it works to simply collect and process data directly from the data collection devices. However, this does not scale well when you get more people collecting data, and also means your data is not backed up - if you lose the device, you can lose the data.</description>

      <description>Overview Quality Assurance and Quality Control is the process by which mappers, and OpenStreetMap contributors in general, check data to ensure that all information uploaded to OSM meets high standards for usage and to prevent vandalism. As OpenStreetMap is a free and open platform that anyone can use and edit, it is critical to the sustainability of open data and OSM that everyone participates in the quality assurance and quality control process – from field data collection to data cleaning to long-term maintenance of existing OSM data.</description>

      <guid>/pages/data-use-and-analysis/8.3_web_and_interactive_maps/</guid>
      <description>Overview Interactive maps are viewed as the modern equivalent of visual communication with maps. This involves the creation and study of the visual representation of data(maps). To communicate information clearly and efficiently, data visualization uses statistical graphics, plots, information graphics and other tools. The use of interactive maps gives users an opportunity to change the display of the map to one&amp;rsquo;s preferences freely.
This section covers two tools for creating interactive maps using OSM data: uMap and Overpass Turbo.</description>
