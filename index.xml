      <description>In this section, Project Managers will find guides, tools and resources to design a mapping project including:
 Considerations and question guides for determining project factors such as scope, scale, and logistics; Resources for selecting hardware; Guides and materials for planning workshops/trainings.
  
There is no one way to collect data in the field and it will vary by context. However, there are some essential topics and questions all project managers and OSM communities should consider when Designing and Coordinating a Mapping Project.</description>

      <description>Overview OpenMapKit (OMK) is an additional application that is used to support ODK Collect in determining the position of objects found during precise and precise field surveys. OpenMapKit can be run through ODK Collect, after you open and select one of the available forms. In determining the location of an object, OpenMapKit requires a map background in the form of a satellite imagery or OSM map. If you use the OSM as the map background, the thing to note is that the data must be available on the OSM server.</description>

      <description>Overview OSMTracker is an android application that allows us to record our survey data. Similar to GPS, OSMTracker is able to record waypoint and also track. If you want to learn more about GPS for field survey, you can see the GPS Module. What makes OSMTracker different with common GPS device is its capability to take pictures when you collect the survey data. With these images taken, it will make your mapping more easier because you can track back what object you have been taken and take a look into your pictures for more detail.</description>

      <description>Overview Central to effective and successful field data collection is a well thought out field data collection plan. This will ensure that field teams face the least number of challenges while out in the field, thus reducing the number of calls for field support coming to the supervisor.
When planning to deploy a team, it is important for the Supervisor to have a good picture of how many work days they have versus the man power available to do the work.</description>

      <description>Overview QGIS (or Quantum GIS) is a free and open source geographic information system (GIS) program. GIS programs allow users to display, manage, and analyze geospatial information on the computer, and create map products. Geospatial data that can be used in GIS includes aerial imagery, GPS data, and spatial datasets.
This section covers the basic skills necessary to using QGIS. These skills include:
 Installing QGIS Navigating QGIS Adding data Styling layers Installing Plugins  Installing and using QuickMapServices Installing and using QuickOSM   Following completion of this section, a new user should be prepared to navigate and work with data in QGIS.</description>

      <description>Overview Interactive maps are viewed as the modern equivalent of visual communication with maps. This involves the creation and study of the visual representation of data(maps). To communicate information clearly and efficiently, data visualization uses statistical graphics, plots, information graphics and other tools. The use of interactive maps gives users an opportunity to change the display of the map to one&amp;rsquo;s preferences freely.
This section covers two tools for creating interactive maps using OSM data: uMap and Overpass Turbo.</description>
