      <guid>/pages/digitization-and-editing/3.5_validating_with_josm/</guid>
      <description>Overview Validation is a process of checking the data quality (in this case, map data quality) for accuracy, consistency, completeness and anomaly. Validation is important to maintain the quality of OSM data. When checking for accuracy, you need to make sure that the map data is aligned with the imagery and is correct in terms of geometry. For consistency, make sure that all mapped objects are consistent in shape. For example, when you found a residential area, make sure all the buildings are consistently traced and orthogonalized.</description>

      <guid>/pages/data-collection-and-field-mapping/4.1-designing-the-data-model/</guid>
      <description>Overview When beginning a mapping project, a data model will need to be created in order to determine what features are mapped and the details collected for each of those features. A data model defines what features are surveyed or mapped and what attributes are collected for each feature. If a project will upload data to OpenStreetMap, the data model should be designed to match OSM tagging.
Example data models:</description>

      <description>Overview OpenMapKit (OMK) is an extension that launches directly from within OpenDataKit (ODK) Collect when the OpenStreetMap question type is enabled in a standard survey. It is what allows you to browse OSM features, and to create and edit OSM tags.
Not sure if OpenMapKit is right for your project? Review Data Collection Applications.

      <guid>/pages/data-collection-and-field-mapping/4.7-data-collection-servers/</guid>
      <description>Overview When beginning a mapping project, many organizations ask if they need to have a server. After collecting data, you’ll need to get the data from the devices. Sometimes, it works to simply collect and process data directly from the data collection devices. However, this does not scale well when you get more people collecting data, and also means your data is not backed up - if you lose the device, you can lose the data.</description>

Skills and Technology Needed * JOSM
Step 1. Create folders Create the folder structure for the data cleaning process.
 Create primary working folder: [omk_field_data_cleaning] Create a container folder: [village_name]_[current-date]. For example: akweteyman_2019-01-31 Create a sub-folders within the container folder:  Add a folder for the raw data: /01_raw_[yourOSMname] Add a folder for the working data: /02_working_[yourOSMname] Add a folder for the final data: /03_final_[yourOSMname]   Step 2.</description>

      <description>Overview OpenMapKit (OMK) is an additional application that is used to support ODK Collect in determining the position of objects found during precise and precise field surveys. OpenMapKit can be run through ODK Collect, after you open and select one of the available forms. In determining the location of an object, OpenMapKit requires a map background in the form of a satellite imagery or OSM map. If you use the OSM as the map background, the thing to note is that the data must be available on the OSM server.</description>

      <description>Overview Data collected in the field should always be cleaned for errors and rectified with existing OSM data before upload. There are a lot of OSM data editors available, but in this module the OSM data editor used is JOSM. JOSM has a lot of useful tools and plugins, making OSM mapping a lot easier but most importantly, it is the easiest tool and best tool for maintaining quality OSM data while importing batches of field data into OSM.</description>

      <description>Overview OSMTracker is an android application that allows us to record our survey data. Similar to GPS, OSMTracker is able to record waypoint and also track. If you want to learn more about GPS for field survey, you can see the GPS Module. What makes OSMTracker different with common GPS device is its capability to take pictures when you collect the survey data. With these images taken, it will make your mapping more easier because you can track back what object you have been taken and take a look into your pictures for more detail.</description>

      <title>5.4 Managing Teams in the Field using OsmAnd and QGIS</title>

      <guid>/pages/field-mapping-management/5.4_managing_teams_in_the_field/</guid>
      <description>Overview Central to effective and successful field data collection is a well thought out field data collection plan. This will ensure that field teams face the least number of challenges while out in the field, thus reducing the number of calls for field support coming to the supervisor.
When planning to deploy a team, it is important for the Supervisor to have a good picture of how many work days they have versus the man power available to do the work.</description>

      <guid>/pages/data-cleaning-upload-and-quality-assurance/5.4-quality-assurance-tools/</guid>
      <description>Overview Quality Assurance and Quality Control is the process by which mappers, and OpenStreetMap contributors in general, check data to ensure that all information uploaded to OSM meets high standards for usage and to prevent vandalism. As OpenStreetMap is a free and open platform that anyone can use and edit, it is critical to the sustainability of open data and OSM that everyone participates in the quality assurance and quality control process – from field data collection to data cleaning to long-term maintenance of existing OSM data.</description>

      <description>Humanitarian Data Exchange (HDX) is a data platform for storing and sharing humanitarian data. The platform is managed by OCHA&amp;rsquo;s Centre for Humanitarian Data. Types of data available on HDX include: Data includes:
 Geospatial datasets CSVs &amp;amp; spreadsheets text &amp;amp; image files  Working with HDX In this activity, you will practice using Humanitarian Data Exchange (HDX) for downloading OSM data for use in QGIS. HDX is an online-based tool, so you will need to be patient with internet connectivity.</description>

      <guid>/pages/data-use-and-analysis/8.1-qgis/</guid>
      <description>Overview QGIS (or Quantum GIS) is a free and open source geographic information system (GIS) program. GIS programs allow users to display, manage, and analyze geospatial information on the computer, and create map products. Geospatial data that can be used in GIS includes aerial imagery, GPS data, and spatial datasets.
This section covers the basic skills necessary to using QGIS. These skills include:
 Installing QGIS Navigating QGIS Adding data Styling layers Installing Plugins  Installing and using QuickMapServices Installing and using QuickOSM   Following completion of this section, a new user should be prepared to navigate and work with data in QGIS.</description>

      <description>Creating an atlas in QGIS allows users to create a series of maps for geographic regions with a set template. This atlas template allows for a large number of maps to be generated for areas of interest, such as districts, wards, and other administrative areas, with the same style and layout.

      <guid>/pages/data-use-and-analysis/8.3_web_and_interactive_maps/</guid>
      <description>Overview Interactive maps are viewed as the modern equivalent of visual communication with maps. This involves the creation and study of the visual representation of data(maps). To communicate information clearly and efficiently, data visualization uses statistical graphics, plots, information graphics and other tools. The use of interactive maps gives users an opportunity to change the display of the map to one&amp;rsquo;s preferences freely.
This section covers two tools for creating interactive maps using OSM data: uMap and Overpass Turbo.</description>
