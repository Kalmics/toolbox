      <description>Creating a New Print Composer
Open the ‘Project’ menu from the main toolbar, and select ‘New Print Composer’. In the pop-up window, create a title for your map. This can be a unique name to describe your map’s purpose such as “Political Map of Liberia” or simple such as “Map 1”.
A new window will be created with a blank page. This shows how your map will look printed out.</description>

      <description>There is no one way to collect data in the field and it will vary by context – but the following steps cover the essential steps you should take.
1. Coordinate with the local administration of the area you will be mapping
This entails identifying and contacting partner organisations working locally in the area that you are planning to map. Contacting these can be done via email, however, a letter or document detailing your intent weighs much more.</description>

      <description>Local Empowerment for Government Inclusion and Transparency (LEGIT) The Liberia Local Empowerment for Government Inclusion and Transparency (LEGIT) project supports the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Governance Commission as they lead, monitor and coordinate the implementation of the government’s decentralization agenda.
HOT, in close coordination with the LEGIT project team, have contributed to several areas of the project, working with the Ministry of Internal Affairs (MIA)’s Department of Urban Affairs, city administrations in the cities of Gbarnga, Ganta and Zwedru, and selected CSOs and CBOs.</description>

      <description>There are many components to managing logistics for field operations. The topics listed below are just a few components that we recommend all organizations and communities consider prior to starting field mapping activities.
Authorization from district and other officials
In many cases, mapping teams will need to carry an authorization letter or another form of permission from local officials to show credibility and to reduce potential conflict that could arise during the field data collection.</description>

      <description>Each context is so different that it is difficult to make specific recommendations for safety. Communities and organizations conducting mapping activities should establish contingency plans to address the different types of security incidents that may occur. Team members should coordinate all responses to such incidents so as to safeguard the rights and well-being of local community members, and ensure that staff members and volunteers are not put at risk.
For operations, the key to effective safety and security management is the creation of a culture of security.</description>

Attendee requirements
Requirements for attendees will vary depending on the scope of the trainings, the intended participants, and the available resources. No matter the scope of the training, it is important to communicate these requirements BEFORE the training so that participants can come prepared.
Some attendee requirements may include:
 Have a laptop and mouse.</description>

      <description>OpenStreetMap is a collaborative project to create a free editable world map and is at the core of HOT&amp;rsquo;s mapping activities. You are free to use it for any purpose as long as you credit OSM and its contributors.
The power of OpenStreetMap is that it empowers anyone, anywhere in the world to add information to a collective map and use the data for any purpose. You can think of OSM as the “Wikipedia of maps” – it is an online database and global community of over 5 million registered users.</description>

      <description>With OpenStreetMap (OSM) at the core of mapping activities, it is critical that all team members and participants have activated OSM accounts. This will be necessary before using many mapping tools such as HOT Tasking Manager, JOSM, and HOT Export Tool.

      <description>The HOT Tasking Manager is a mapping tool designed and built for the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team&amp;rsquo;s collaborative mapping process in OpenStreetMap. The purpose of the tool is to divide up a mapping project into smaller tasks that can be completed rapidly with many people working on the same overall area. It shows which areas need to be mapped and which areas need the mapping validated.

      <description>Assessing available imagery Satellite imagery There is only a limited number of companies/satellites that actually capture most of the available satellite imagery, with many more resellers providing access to and selling imagery. See Wikipedia for a good introduction. When assessing the imagery available for your project, try to look for:
 Freshness (the date of the imagery) Resolution Quality (color, contract, obliqueness/angle of imagery, lack of cloud cover)  Some useful tools to help in this:</description>

      <description>There are several ways to edit in OpenStreetMap. The two most commonly used tools and best programs for mapping projects are iD editor and JOSM.
iD Editor
The iD editor is a user-friendly tool that allows you to directly make changes in OpenStreetMap. iD is good for:
 Simple edits Fast Internet access to load the imagery and save the edits. Following a consistent and simple tagging scheme. When you are restricted from installing a program on the computer you are using.</description>

      <description>Tagging Tags are used in OSM to categorize features, and to add information that is useful for: * Understanding of the map * Planning * Routing * Querying
OSM doesn’t work with layers or attribute tables, but tags. Each tag consists of a key, and a value. Each map feature should have 1 or more tags Such as: * building=residential * highway=primary * amenity=school

      <description>MBTiles (.mbtiles) is the file format used for storing map tiles as a single file - the most common use case as baselayers for mobile mapping applications. There are multiple tools to create mbtiles, with selection based on baselayer type (aerial imagery), addition of vector layers, file size, zoom, etc.

      <description>Server data in this case refers to data sent to a server from the field. This data then has to be downloaded from the server, in order to prepare it for cleaning and validation. We will take for example data collected during the NMP Building Validation Project in Botswana. Servers used can be:

Skills and Technology Needed * JOSM
Step 1. Create folders Create the folder structure for the data cleaning process.
 Create primary working folder: [omk_field_data_cleaning] Create a container folder: [village_name]_[current-date]. For example: akweteyman_2019-01-31 Create a sub-folders within the container folder:  Add a folder for the raw data: /01_raw_[yourOSMname] Add a folder for the working data: /02_working_[yourOSMname] Add a folder for the final data: /03_final_[yourOSMname]   Step 2.</description>

 Filters is a built-in tool that allows you to disable, hide, select, and highlight specific groups of objects based on flexible custom parameters. This tool will help you to spot and avoid common mistakes, and review data. The Validation Tool is another built-in tool that will review and search for common errors as well as provide warnings about potentially problematic data.</description>

As OpenStreetMap is a free and open platform that anyone can use and edit, it is critical to the sustainability of open data and OSM that everyone participates in the quality assurance and quality control process – from field data collection to data cleaning to long-term maintenance of existing OSM data.</description>

      <description>Creating an atlas in QGIS allows users to create a series of maps for geographic regions with a set template. This atlas template allows for a large number of maps to be generated for areas of interest, such as districts, wards, and other administrative areas, with the same style and layout.

      <description>Overview When beginning a mapping project, many organizations ask if they need to have a server. After collecting data, you’ll need to get the data from the devices. Sometimes, it works to simply collect and process data directly from the data collection devices. However, this does not scale well when you get more people collecting data, and also means your data is not backed up - if you lose the device, you can lose the data.</description>
