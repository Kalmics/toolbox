      <description>There are a handful of free Data Use and Analysis tools available to use your field generated data, extract and utilize OSM data, or combine datasets to create maps, atlases, and other visuals for decision making.
 8.1 Introduction to QGIS provides an introduction to the open source geographic information system (GIS) software that allows you to analyze and edit spatial information, as well as compose and export geographic maps. Additionally, the section includes a step-by-step guide that project managers can use in trainings for installing QGIS and learning basic skills.</description>

      <description>Creating a New Print Composer
Open the ‘Project’ menu from the main toolbar, and select ‘New Print Composer’. In the pop-up window, create a title for your map. This can be a unique name to describe your map’s purpose such as “Political Map of Liberia” or simple such as “Map 1”.
A new window will be created with a blank page. This shows how your map will look printed out.</description>

      <description>Overview QGIS (or Quantum GIS) is a free and open source geographic information system (GIS) program. GIS programs allow users to display, manage, and analyze geospatial information on the computer, and create map products. Geospatial data that can be used in GIS includes aerial imagery, GPS data, and spatial datasets.
This section covers the basic skills necessary to using QGIS. These skills include:
 Installing QGIS Navigating QGIS Adding data Styling layers Installing Plugins  Installing and using QuickMapServices Installing and using QuickOSM   Following completion of this section, a new user should be prepared to navigate and work with data in QGIS.</description>

      <title>8.2 Creating Maps and Atlases in QGIS</title>
      <link>/pages/data-use-and-analysis/8.2-creating-an-atlas-in-qgis/</link>

      <description>Creating an atlas in QGIS allows users to create a series of maps for geographic regions with a set template. This atlas template allows for a large number of maps to be generated for areas of interest, such as districts, wards, and other administrative areas, with the same style and layout.

      <description>Overview Interactive maps are viewed as the modern equivalent of visual communication with maps. This involves the creation and study of the visual representation of data(maps). To communicate information clearly and efficiently, data visualization uses statistical graphics, plots, information graphics and other tools. The use of interactive maps gives users an opportunity to change the display of the map to one&amp;rsquo;s preferences freely.
This section covers two tools for creating interactive maps using OSM data: uMap and Overpass Turbo.</description>
