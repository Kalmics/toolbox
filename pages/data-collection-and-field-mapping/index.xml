      <description>In this section, Project Managers will find tools and resources to determine which data collection tools are appropriate and how to navigate the technical steps needed to prepare for a field mapping project including:
 Presentations and step-by-step guides for developing a data model suitable for uploading to OpenStreetMap
 Resources for determining the correct mobile data collection, navigation applications, and server options for your project Detailed guides and resources for setting up applications such as OpenMapKit  Any field project will require some degree of Field Mapping Technical Set-Up regardless of the complexity of the data collection workflow.</description>

      <description>This section provides:
 An overview of data models and OpenStreetMap tagging, including presentation slides Step-by-step instructions for tools to help build your data model Step-by-step instructions for creating your data model  Overview When beginning a mapping project, a data model will need to be created in order to determine what features are mapped and the details collected for each of those features. A data model defines what features are surveyed or mapped and what attributes are collected for each feature.</description>

      <description>Overview Several mobile applications exist to assist with field data collection. Choosing an application to use depends on mobile device capability, varying set-up requirements, and survey needs. Options include OpenDataKit, OpenMapKit, KoboCollect, OSMTracker, and Maps.me

      <title>4.2.2 Setting up OpenMapKit</title>
      <link>/pages/data-collection-and-field-mapping/4.2.2_setting_up_omk/</link>

      <guid>/pages/data-collection-and-field-mapping/4.2.2_setting_up_omk/</guid>
      <description>Overview OpenMapKit (OMK) is an extension that launches directly from within OpenDataKit (ODK) Collect when the OpenStreetMap question type is enabled in a standard survey. It is what allows you to browse OSM features, and to create and edit OSM tags.
Not sure if OpenMapKit is right for your project? Review Data Collection Applications.
Set-up Process
 [Create OMK forms] [Create .mbtiles] [Create .osm layer] [Optional: Set-up constraint file] [Download and set up ODK and OMK applications] [Add all above files to mobile data collection devices]  1.</description>

      <title>4.3 Navigation Applications</title>
      <link>/pages/data-collection-and-field-mapping/4.3-navigation-applications/</link>

      <guid>/pages/data-collection-and-field-mapping/4.3-navigation-applications/</guid>
      <description>Overview Several mobile applications exist to assist with field navigation using OpenStreetMap as a baselayer and functioning offline for low-connection environments. Options include OSMAnd [1] and Maps.me [2].
While navigation tools are not required for data collection, they can be extremely useful for data collection teams in navigating to field locations, as well as for supervisors and project managers to understand where their teams have been.
Additional benefits of navigation applications include:</description>

      <title>4.7 Data Collection Servers</title>
      <link>/pages/data-collection-and-field-mapping/4.7-data-collection-servers/</link>

      <guid>/pages/data-collection-and-field-mapping/4.7-data-collection-servers/</guid>
      <description>Overview When beginning a mapping project, many organizations ask if they need to have a server. After collecting data, you’ll need to get the data from the devices. Sometimes, it works to simply collect and process data directly from the data collection devices. However, this does not scale well when you get more people collecting data, and also means your data is not backed up - if you lose the device, you can lose the data.</description>
