      <description>Tagging Tags are used in OSM to categorize features, and to add information that is useful for: * Understanding of the map * Planning * Routing * Querying
OSM doesn’t work with layers or attribute tables, but tags. Each tag consists of a key, and a value. Each map feature should have 1 or more tags Such as: * building=residential * highway=primary * amenity=school
Resources  Check the OpenStreetMap wiki.</description>

      <description>Several mobile applications exist to assist with field navigation using OpenStreetMap as a baselayer and functioning offline for low-connection environments. Options include OSMAnd and Maps.me
1. OSMAnd OSMAnd is a global mobile map viewing and navigation app for online and offline OSM Maps. It is used for recording tracks as well as mapping features. It provides easy way to record and submit information in the field.

      <description>Form design Creating ODK forms
Forms can be created using spreadsheet software (such as Excel or LibreCalc) or using the ODK Form Builder. Documentation on how to design a form can be found here.
 Example ODK form Blank ODK form  Creating OMK forms Forms for OMK are slightly altered from ODK forms to incorporate the OSM tagging scheme and need to be built using spreadsheet software (such as Excel or LibreCalc).</description>

      <description>Overview MBTiles (.mbtiles) is the file format used for storing map tiles as a single file - the most common use case as baselayers for mobile mapping applications. There are multiple tools to create mbtiles, with selection based on baselayer type (aerial imagery), addition of vector layers, file size, zoom, etc.
  I need .mbtiles with...  HOT Export Tool  Tile Mill  TileHuria    Aerial Imagery Basemap  X  ✅  ✅    OSM Basemap  ✅  X  ✅    Vector layers (i.</description>

      <title>4.6 Creating .osm Layers for OMK</title>
      <link>/pages/data-collection-and-field-mapping/4.6-creating-osm-layers-for-omk/</link>

      <guid>/pages/data-collection-and-field-mapping/4.6-creating-osm-layers-for-omk/</guid>
      <description>Overview To conduct data collection using OpenMapKit (OMK), you will need to create an .osm layer. This .osm layer provides the buildings for selection in the OMK application.
Skills and Technology Needed
 Computer Internet Connection JOSM Installed Basic JOSM skills  Creating an .osm layer with JOSM In JOSM, click the top-menu File &amp;gt; New Layer to start. Then click the top-menu File &amp;gt; Download Data.
In the &amp;lsquo;Download&amp;rsquo; window, click the tab &amp;lsquo;Download from Overpass API&amp;rsquo;.</description>

      <title>4.7 Data Collection Servers</title>

      <guid>/pages/data-collection-and-field-mapping/4.7-data-collection-servers/</guid>
      <description>Overview When beginning a mapping project, many organizations ask if they need to have a server. After collecting data, you’ll need to get the data from the devices. Sometimes, it works to simply collect and process data directly from the data collection devices. However, this does not scale well when you get more people collecting data, and also means your data is not backed up - if you lose the device, you can lose the data.</description>
