## Overview
To conduct data collection using [OpenMapKit (OMK)](https://hotosm.github.io/toolbox/pages/data-collection-and-field-mapping/4.2-data-collection-applications/#2-openmapkit-omk), you will need to create an .osm layer. This .osm layer provides the buildings for selection in the OMK application. 

**Skills and Technology Needed**

*  Computer
*  Internet Connection
*  JOSM Installed
*  Basic JOSM skills

## Creating an .osm layer with JOSM

In JOSM, click the top-menu File > New Layer to start. Then click the top-menu File > Download Data.

In the 'Download' window, click the tab 'Download from Overpass API'. This will allow you to download data with specific key=value tags in an area of interest. The top of this tab provides space for a query to be entered. Click 'Query Wizard.'

For an OMK .osm layer, we want a layer with only building polygons. In the search bar, type "building=*". This will return an OSM feature with a building tag. Click 'Build query'.

In the slippy map below the Overpass query, navigate to your area of interest in OSM. Drag the map by holding down the right-click button and dragging your mouse. To zoom, use the '+'/'-' keys on your keyboard. Once navigated to your AOI, hold down the left-button of your mouse or navigation pad and drag your mouse to create a pink box. This pink box is your *bounding box*, all buildings within this area will be downloaded. When complete, click 'Download'.

Right click on the layer file in the 'Layers' window. Click 'Save as'. The default file type is OSM Server Files (*.osm), this is the correct file type.

Once saved, this file can be uploaded to devices for data collection with OMK.
