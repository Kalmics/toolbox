      <description>OpenStreetMap is a collaborative project to create a free editable world map and is at the core of HOT&amp;rsquo;s mapping activities. You are free to use it for any purpose as long as you credit OSM and its contributors.
You can think of OSM as the “Wikipedia of maps” – it is an online database and global community of over 4 million registered users. This community collaborates to build a free and open map of the world to which anyone can contribute and which anyone can use in their own context.</description>
