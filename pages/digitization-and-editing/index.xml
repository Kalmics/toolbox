      <description>Objective:
 To be able to operate and navigate the OpenStreetMap website To be able to see object information in OpenStreetMap To be able to create share link in OpenStreetMap To be able to save images from OpenStreetMap To be able to create user account in OpenStreetMap To be able to understand the basic concept of attribute in OpenStreetMap To be able to understand history in OpenStreetMap  After you understand the basic of OpenStreetMap in the previous module, you can immediately start using OpenStreetMap.</description>

      <title>Resolving Conflict on OpenStreetMap Data (OSM)</title>

      <description>Objectives:
 Participants can explain what is data conflict on OpenStreetMap Participants knowing about types of conflict in JOSM Participants can fix data conflicts using JOSM Participants know to avoid data conflict in JOSM  When you are uploading your changes in JSOM, some contributors might also do editing in your area. This might occur data conflict in your uploading process. Therefore, in this module, you will learn about data conflict in OpenStreetMap, types of conflict, and how to fix it using JOSM.</description>

      <title>3.1 Working with the HOT Tasking Manager</title>

      <description>The HOT Tasking Manager is a mapping tool designed and built for the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team&amp;rsquo;s collaborative mapping process in OpenStreetMap. The purpose of the tool is to divide up a mapping project into smaller tasks that can be completed rapidly with many people working on the same overall area. It shows which areas need to be mapped and which areas need the mapping validated.
Note: To become a project manager send an email to info@hotosm.</description>

      <description>Assessing available imagery Satellite imagery There is only a limited number of companies/satellites that actually capture most of the available satellite imagery, with many more resellers providing access to and selling imagery. See Wikipedia for a good introduction. When assessing the imagery available for your project, try to look for:
 Freshness (the date of the imagery) Resolution Quality (color, contract, obliqueness/angle of imagery, lack of cloud cover)  Some useful tools to help in this:</description>

      <title>3.3 Editing with iD and JOSM</title>

      <description>There are several ways to edit in OpenStreetMap. The two most commonly used tools and best programs for mapping projects are iD editor and JOSM.
iD Editor
The iD editor is a user-friendly tool that allows you to directly make changes in OpenStreetMap. iD is good for:
 Simple edits Fast Internet access to load the imagery and save the edits. Following a consistent and simple tagging scheme. When you are restricted from installing a program on the computer you are using.</description>

      <title>3.4 Organized OSM Editing</title>

      <description>Before starting any mapping project, it is important to assess, and if necessary, update the OpenStreetMap basemap through remote mapping. This remote mapping process helps ensure that the buildings and roads used during a field mapping phase are up to date, improving the quality and effectiveness of field mapping efforts. For example, using remote mapping, your team can identify buildings or entire villages that might have been missed during field mapping efforts.</description>
