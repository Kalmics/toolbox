      <description>In this section, Project Managers will find guides, tools and resources to design a mapping project including: * Considerations and question guides for determining project factors such as scope, scale, and logistics; * Resources for selecting hardware; * Guides and materials for planning workshops/trainings.

There is no one way to collect data in the field and it will vary by context. However, there are some essential topics and questions all project managers and OSM communities should consider when Designing and Coordinating a Mapping Project.</description>

      <description>Overview When starting a mapping project, it is important to define the scope of the project and understand the larger context in which the data is needed, this includes understanding how to work with local stakeholders and how the data will impact them. This section includes guiding questions and considerations that project managers and OSM communities should consider when beginning a project.
Deciding what to map  Purpose and audience: All data collected needs to fulfill a specific purpose with an intended use case and/or audience.</description>

      <title>2.2 Safety, Security, and Logistics for Field Operations</title>

      <description>Overview For projects requiring field work, you will need to take extra steps to ensure that logistics and security are effectively handled. The following are topics that project managers should consider and have plans for before entering the field. Work with donors, local partners, and stakeholders to fill information gaps and meet these needs.
Logistics There are many components to managing logistics for field operations. The topics listed below are just a few components that we recommend all organizations and communities consider prior to starting field mapping activities.</description>

      <title>2.3 Selecting Hardware</title>
      <link>/pages/running-a-mapping-project/2.3-hardware/</link>

      <description>Overview Hardware encompasses all physical assets related to technology, computers, and electronics needed for a project. When designing a mapping project, managers will need to assess what hardware, and specifications, are necessary to complete the work. While the anticipated project workflow influences the selection of hardware, it is important to note that the availability of technology and resources for procurement may place restrictions on hardware selection. In this way, hardware availability can also influence the workflow, making hardware selection an important part of the planning process.</description>

      <title>2.4 Trainings and Workshops</title>
      <link>/pages/running-a-mapping-project/2.4-trainings-and-workshops/</link>

      <guid>/pages/running-a-mapping-project/2.4-trainings-and-workshops/</guid>
      <description>Overview Most mapping projects will involve trainings or workshops of some kind, whether training field mappers to use OpenDataKit, training local government stakeholders how to export and use OSM data, or training students in QGIS for creating maps. During the planning stage, project managers and OSM communities should anticipate what trainings are necessary and what resources will be required to run each training or workshop.
This section covers considerations and resources to use while planning trainings and workshops for mapping and OSM.</description>
