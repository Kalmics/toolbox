                        <h1>Welcome to HOT Toolbox</h1>

<p>The HOT Toolbox is designed to provide OSM Communities and HOT teams with step-by-step guides of technical processes as well as a repository of training materials developed by HOT from setting up mobile devices for mapping to exporting OSM data.</p>

<p>Many pages in this wiki will contain Training Materials produced by HOT. These materials are uploaded under CC by 4.0 which means they are free to use and be modified - we simply ask that you credit HOT and maintain a Creative Commons License. Learn more about Creative Commons and free use here.</p>

<p>In addition to providing HOT materials, this toolbox curates a large amount of resources that already exist for the various components of mapping projects, from software guides to running mapathons.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-use-the-toolbox">How to Use the Toolbox</h2>

<p>The Toolbox is designed to take a project manager or community from the start of a mapping project to use and analysis. However, not every mapping project is the same. Some projects might use OpenMapKit for data collection while others might simply use Maps.ME. Even others might not even conduct field mapping activities but run digitization projects instead.
<br><br>
For this reason, HOT has provided example workflows in <strong>Getting Started</strong> that guide a reader through example projects to identify which tools and processes are right for your project. Additionally, this section provides an overview of the HOT tools, including those we have developed and those we have adopted for our projects.
<br><br>
<strong>If you are not sure where to begin a project</strong> use this section to find a workflow that best suits a projectâ€™s goals or resources. Each of these example workflows will guide through the exact steps used in the project by linking to the relevant sections in the Toolbox.
<br><br>
<strong>If you are looking for specific guidance</strong> on a phase of a mapping project, a tool, or a process, use the left-hand navigation or the search bar to look for a particular guide.

<h2 id="overview-of-the-toolbox-sections">Overview of the Toolbox Sections</h2>

<p><strong>Designing and Coordinating a Mapping Project</strong> provides readers with an introduction to the components that project managers should consider and take into account before beginning their mapping projects.<br />
<br><br>
<strong>Digitization and Editing</strong> provides project managers with training materials and guides on managing the digitization process and which remote mapping tools are best for a project.
<br><br>
<strong>Field Mapping Technical Set-up</strong> provides project managers with the technical steps for selecting which mobile data collection application is best for their project, setting up those applications (such as ODK and OMK) for use in the field, and whether or not data collection servers are necessary for their project.
<br><br>
<strong>Field Mapping Management</strong> provides steps and guides for field mappers and supervisors to use mobile data collection applications, as well as providing tips for managing teams in the field.
<br><br>
<strong>Data Cleaning Upload and Quality Assurance</strong> covers the process of taking field mapped data through cleaning and upload to OpenStreetMap while ensuring strong data quality.
<br><br>
<strong>Data Export Tools</strong> covers the various tools used for exporting data from OpenStreetMap** **and which tools are best for different use cases.
<br><br>
<strong>Data Use and Analysis</strong> provides an introduction to how data can be turned into effective maps for decision making.</p>
